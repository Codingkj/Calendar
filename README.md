# Calendar
A one month calendar (November 2015 chosen), that allows a user to enter one task per day. 
When the user clicks on the form, they can enter task, and save it or cancel it.
Once the task is entered, the date is highlighted, and if the user then clicks on that date again, the previous information entered is displayed for editing or removal.
First edition of this calendar is to use Javascript only, DOM nodes to be created in JS (not HTML).  No jQuery.
